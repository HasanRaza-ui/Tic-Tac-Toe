# Tic-Tac-Toe (C++17, Object-Oriented Design)

A clean, modular implementation of Tic-Tac-Toe using Modern C++ principles.  
Includes board evaluation logic, a simple AI, and separation of UI/game engine.

## 💡 Features
- Object-oriented architecture (Board, Player, GameEngine)
- Input validation and game state handling
- Simple CPU opponent (minimax-lite logic)
- Console-based UI

## 🛠️ Technical Highlights
- **RAII-compliant class design**
- Reinforces **encapsulation**, **state management**, and **clean header/source separation**
- Safe memory management (no raw pointers)
- Fully portable (no dependencies)

## 📦 Build Instructions

mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
./tic_tac_toe


## 🧪 What This Demonstrates
- Ability to structure C++ programs cleanly
- Understanding of OOP design patterns
- Writing **maintainable, testable C++ code**

## 📈 Future Improvements
- Full minimax with alpha–beta pruning
- GUI using Qt or SFML
- Add unit tests (Catch2)
